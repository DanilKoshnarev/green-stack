# This module initializes the core domain components for the green platform.

# Import necessary modules from each domain
from .data_analysis import *
from .integration import *
from .visualization import *

# Define interfaces for interaction between domains
# Example: from .interfaces import IDataAnalysis, IIntegration, IVisualization

# Initialize services and repositories
# Example: data_analysis_service = DataAnalysisService()
# integration_service = IntegrationService()
# visualization_service = VisualizationService()

# Ensure dependency inversion and SOLID principles are followed
# Example: Use interfaces to define interactions between services

# Additional setup or configuration can be added here
